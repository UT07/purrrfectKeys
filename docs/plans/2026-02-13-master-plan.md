## Completed Phases (Summary)

### Phase 1: Core Loop
Exercise Player with PianoRoll + Keyboard, 5-dimensional scoring engine, nearest-note matching, XP/levels/streaks, AI Coach (Gemini 2.0 Flash), ContentLoader for 30 JSON exercises across 6 lessons, ExpoAudioEngine with round-robin voice pools, MIDI input architecture.

### Phase 2: Gamification & Polish
LevelMapScreen (Duolingo-style), Concert Hall dark theme, profile editing, all 30 exercises validated, audio engine rewrite (JSI WebAudio + Expo fallback), mascot system (12 cats), ScoreRing, PressableScale, transition screens, multi-touch keyboard.

### Phase 3: Firebase Auth + Sync
Firebase Auth (Email, Google, Apple, Anonymous), SyncManager with offline queue + Firestore pull/merge, cross-device sync ("highest wins"), local-to-cloud migration, auth resilience (guest fallback, 8s timeout).

### Phase 4+: Adaptive Learning + UI Overhaul
22 tasks: design tokens, learner profile store, cat dialogue engine (12 cats x 14 triggers), Gemini exercise generation + buffer manager, skill assessment screen, screen redesigns, SplitKeyboard, 32 achievements, cat quest service.

### Phase 5 + 5.2: Adaptive Learning Revamp + 365-Day Curriculum (~90% + 100%)
SkillTree DAG (100 nodes, 15 tiers, 12 categories), CurriculumEngine (4 session types), skill decay (14-day half-life), AI generation for tiers 7-15, DailySessionScreen, VoiceCoachingService + TTSService, WeakSpotDetector, DifficultyEngine, FreePlayAnalyzer, 150+ new tests.

**Phase 5 Known Gaps (to be addressed alongside Phase 7.5):**
- Free play coaching UI not fully wired (post-play feedback card + "Generate drill" CTA)
- Voice coaching (TTS) not consistently triggered on all exercise completions
- Pre-exercise coaching tips ("Focus on your left hand") not surfaced in ExercisePlayer UI
- DifficultyEngine tempo progression not visible to user (no UI indicator)

### Phase 6 + 6.5: Avatar Evolution & Gamification + AI Coach Fix
4-stage evolution (Baby/Teen/Adult/Master), gem currency, 12 abilities via AbilityEngine, CatCollectionScreen, EvolutionReveal animation, GemEarnPopup, onboarding cat selection. AI Coach: 10 bugs fixed (pitchErrors, missedCount, cache, temperature), FreePlay expanded to 48 scales, gamification fully wired.

### Phase 7: UI Revamp + Game Feel & Polish
Concert Hall palette (black + crimson), typography/shadow/animation/glow token systems, composable SVG cat system (12 profiles), Reanimated pose system (7 poses), SalsaCoach NPC, high-impact screen redesigns (Home, CompletionModal, DailySession, Profile), custom tab bar, ExerciseLoadingScreen, hardcoded hex tokenization, cat character renames (Vinyl→Ballymakawww, Noodle→Shibu, Pixel→Bella).

## Phase 7.5: All-AI Exercise Generation (IN PROGRESS)

**Problem:** Only 36 static exercises (~45 min of gameplay). Daily players exhaust content in 2-3 days. Tiers 1-6 are hardwired to static JSON; only tiers 7-15 use AI.

**Goal:** Every exercise from tier 1 onward is AI-generated. Static JSON becomes offline fallback only.

**Core bugs being fixed:**
1. AI exercises never award skill mastery (runtime IDs don't match SkillTree lookups)
2. CurriculumEngine has a static-first gate blocking AI for tiers 1-6
3. Exercise buffer is not skill-aware (pre-generates generic exercises)

### Batch Status

| Batch | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Fix skill mastery for AI exercises (skillId route param fallback) | **DONE** |
| 2 | Add GenerationHints to SkillTree (100 nodes with promptHint, targetMidi, hand) | **DONE** |
| 3 | Skill-aware buffer + generation pipeline (geminiExerciseService + buffer) | **TODO** |
| 4 | CurriculumEngine AI-first for all tiers (invert static-first gate) | **DONE** |
| 5 | LevelMap + LessonIntro AI integration (navigate with aiMode) | **TODO** |
| 6 | Offline bootstrap + template integration (first-time experience) | **TODO** |

### Files Modified So Far
- `ExercisePlayer.tsx` — skillIdParam extraction + fallback mastery logic
- `ExercisePlayer.test.tsx` — updated mocks + AI mastery test
- `SkillTree.ts` — GenerationHints interface + GENERATION_HINTS for all 100 nodes + getGenerationHints()
- `SkillTree.test.ts` — 5 new GenerationHints validation tests
- `CurriculumEngine.ts` — ExerciseRef gains `'ai-with-fallback'` source + `fallbackExerciseId` + `makeAIRef()` helper (generator inversion in progress)

### Remaining Work (Batches 3-6)
- **Batch 3:** `geminiExerciseService.ts` accepts GenerationHints in prompt, `exerciseBufferManager.ts` stores targetSkillId per exercise + `getNextExerciseForSkill()` + `fillBufferForSkills()`
- **Batch 4 (in progress):** Invert `generateLesson()`, `generateWarmUp()`, `generateReviewLesson()`, `generateChallenge()` to AI-first. Update `DailySessionScreen.tsx` to handle `'ai-with-fallback'`. Update CurriculumEngine tests.
- **Batch 5:** LevelMapScreen + LessonIntroScreen navigate with `aiMode: true` + skillId for all tiers
- **Batch 6:** templateExercises.ts gains skillId + `getTemplateForSkill()`. Fallback chain: skill template → static JSON → generic template → hardcoded C-major. OnboardingScreen calls `prefillOnboardingBuffer()`.

## Phase 8: Audio Input — Microphone Pitch Detection (SHIP-BLOCKER)

**Problem:** 95%+ of target users don't own MIDI keyboards. Without mic input, the app is a screen-tap trainer.

**Goal:** Low-latency single-note pitch detection via device microphone. Target: <150ms.

### Current State
- `PitchDetector.ts` — interface exists, C++ TurboModule NOT built
- `AudioEngine` architecture ready (WebAudioEngine JSI + ExpoAudioEngine)
- Scoring engine already handles pitch matching — just needs real input events
- `audio-pipeline.md` documents YIN algorithm spec

### Implementation Options
| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| A: C++ TurboModule (YIN) | Lowest latency, spec'd | Most native code work |
| B: expo-av + JS pitch detection | Easy to ship | Higher latency |
| C: Platform native APIs (AVAudioEngine/Oboe) | Best quality | Platform-specific work |

### Key Tasks
1. Choose implementation path
2. Monophonic detection first (polyphonic = research problem)
3. Feed detected pitches as MidiNoteEvent (same interface)
4. Handle sustained notes + ambient noise rejection
5. Calibration flow (mic permission + sensitivity)
6. Input method selector (MIDI / Mic / On-screen)
7. Adaptive timing windows per input method
8. Measure latency on real devices

### Exit Criteria
- Monophonic: >95% accuracy, <200ms latency
- Input method selector in onboarding + settings
- Adaptive timing windows per input type
- Mic calibration flow
- Free play works with mic

---

## Sound Design (PLANNED)

**Problem:** App is silent outside piano note playback. No button sounds, celebrations, feedback, or cat sounds.

### Scope (~20-30 audio assets)
- Button press sounds (tap, toggle, select)
- Celebration sounds (star earned, combo hit, exercise complete, level up)
- Feedback sounds (correct/wrong note, miss)
- Cat sounds (meow greeting, purr reward)
- Countdown ticks

### Design Direction
Hybrid approach: piano-derived sounds for gameplay feedback + cat sounds for mascot interactions.

### Implementation
1. Source/create short .wav assets (<1s each)
2. Create `SoundManager` service (preload + play pattern)
3. Wire into PressableScale, CompletionModal, AchievementToast, ExerciseBuddy, CountInAnimation
4. Separate volume control in settings
5. Respect device silent mode

---

## Rive Animations (PLANNED — Needs Guidance)

**Current state:** SVG composable system with Reanimated poses is functional. `RiveCatAvatar.tsx` placeholder exists but no .riv files.

**What's needed:**
- Rive editor workflow guidance (user has no experience)
- Design + animate 3 cat states minimum: idle, celebrate, teach
- Decision: animate all 12 cats individually vs parameterized rig
- `rive-react-native` integration

**Not a blocker** — current SVG animations work well. This is a quality multiplier.

---

## Music Library (PLANNED)

### Content Pipeline (background work)
- Extend Exercise JSON for songs: layers, sections, difficulty per section, attribution
- MIDI → Exercise JSON conversion script
- 30+ songs: classical (public domain), simplified pop, film/TV, folk, games

### UI Integration
- Browse screen with genre carousel, search, difficulty filter
- Song player: section markers, loop section, skip to chorus
- Song mastery tiers (Bronze → Platinum)
- AI song coaching (trouble spot drills)

---

## Phase 9: Social & Leaderboards (PLANNED)

- Friends system (add via code/link, activity feed)
- Weekly leagues (Bronze → Diamond, 30-person, promotion/demotion)
- Leaderboard UI with animated rank changes
- Friend challenges (beat my score)
- Share achievements to social media
- Firebase backend (Firestore + Cloud Functions for league rotation)
- Push notifications (FCM: reminders, challenges, streak-at-risk)

---

## Phase 10: QA + Launch (PLANNED)

### Weeks 13-14: QA Sprint
- AI quality audit (100 exercises, 20+ coaching scenarios)
- Mic input testing (5+ environments)
- Performance profiling (every screen, target devices)
- Full 30-day simulated journey
- Gamification balance (XP curve, gem rates, evolution milestones)
- Edge cases (kill mid-exercise, airplane mode, background/foreground)
- Accessibility (VoiceOver, dynamic type, color contrast, reduced motion)
- Security (Firebase rules, API keys, input sanitization)

### Week 15: Beta Release
- App Store assets (icon, screenshots, description, privacy policy)
- EAS production builds (iOS + Android)
- TestFlight + internal testing (5-10 testers, 5-day window)
- Critical bug fixes from beta feedback

### Week 16: Launch
- Final fixes
- App Store + Play Store submission
- Launch monitoring (Crashlytics, analytics)
- Post-launch hotfix plan

**Launch is 100% free** — monetization (3-tier freemium) designed post-launch.

## Known Technical Constraints

1. **react-native-screens** pinned to 4.4.0 (Fabric codegen bug with RN 0.76)
2. **Native MIDI module** not installed (needs RN 0.77+). VMPK + IAC Driver ready for testing
3. **Native audio engine** (react-native-audio-api) requires RN 0.77+ for codegen. ExpoAudioEngine is primary
4. **Jest worker teardown warning** — timer leak, non-blocking
5. **~53 open GitHub issues** — to be triaged during QA sprint
