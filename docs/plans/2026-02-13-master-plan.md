---

## Phase 2: Gamification & Polish (IN PROGRESS)

### Completed Items
- Score bug fix (rounded integers)
- LevelMapScreen (Duolingo-style vertical map, replaces LearnScreen)
- Concert Hall dark theme across all 20+ screens/components
- Profile editing (daily goal picker, volume control)
- MIDI testing documentation
- Keyboard auto-scroll + dark theme

### Remaining Items (~3-5 days estimated)

#### 2A. Lessons 2-6 E2E Validation (Priority: HIGH)
**Why:** Content JSON exists for all 6 lessons but only Lesson 1 is tested E2E.

- Add content integrity tests for lessons 2-6 (IDs, MIDI ranges, star thresholds)
- Run scoring pipeline test: perfect play should score 100%, no play scores 0
- Fix any content issues found in exercise JSON
- Verify lesson unlock chain works (lesson-01 → lesson-02 → ... → lesson-06)
- **Effort:** 1 day
- **Files:** `src/content/__tests__/ContentLoader.test.ts`, exercise JSONs

#### 2B. Onboarding Flow Activation (Priority: HIGH)
**Why:** Currently hardcoded to `true` (skips onboarding). New users need the flow.

- OnboardingScreen UI already exists (4 steps: Welcome, Experience, Equipment, Goal)
- Wire to `settingsStore.hasCompletedOnboarding` persistence
- Persist experience level and learning goal on completion
- Navigate to first exercise after onboarding
- **Effort:** 0.5 day
- **Files:** `src/stores/settingsStore.ts`, `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`, `src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx`

#### 2C. UI Polish Pass (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Why:** Production readiness requires visual refinement.

- HomeScreen: level progress bar, gradient header, card shadow consistency
- ProfileScreen: weekly practice chart, gradient stats header
- CompletionModal: confetti for 3-star scores, gradient score ring
- LevelMapScreen: path fill animation on lesson completion
- **Effort:** 2-3 days
- **Files:** HomeScreen, ProfileScreen, CompletionModal, LevelMapScreen

#### 2D. AI Adaptive Learning System (Priority: HIGH — Phase 2 End)
**Full design:** `docs/plans/2026-02-13-adaptive-learning-design.md`

Three increments:
- **2D-1:** Challenge infrastructure — AI generates exercise JSON, validation pipeline, fallback templates (3-4 days)
- **2D-2:** Student skill model — per-skill mastery tracking, adaptive difficulty tuning (2-3 days)
- **2D-3:** Dynamic curriculum — goal-based paths, exercise reordering, LessonFlowController (3-4 days)

Key decisions: play-based challenges (not text quizzes), Gemini generates full exercise JSON, challenges sprinkled every 2 exercises, full personalization (adaptive difficulty + goal paths + AI ordering).

#### 2E. Documentation Sync (Priority: LOW)
- Update TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md (AsyncStorage not MMKV, Zustand v5 patterns)
- Update PRD.md with phase status
- **Effort:** 0.5 day

---

## Phase 3: Music Library (DESIGNED, NOT STARTED)

> Based on brainstorming session. User chose: Hybrid MIDI Pipeline + Community approach, layered song format, all genres, all free at launch, 100+ songs, full gamification.

### 3A. Data Model & Infrastructure (~5 days)

**Song Format:** Extended Exercise JSON with layers
```
Song
├── Metadata (title, artist, genre, difficulty, duration, album art)
├── Layers
│   ├── melody (right hand only) — Exercise JSON
│   ├── leftHand (left hand only) — Exercise JSON
│   └── fullArrangement (both hands) — Exercise JSON
├── Community fields (plays, ratings, arrangements)
└── Mastery tracking (per-layer star ratings)
```

**Storage Plan:**
- Firestore: song metadata + user progress
- Firebase Storage: exercise JSON + album art
- Local cache: downloaded songs for offline play

**Key Tasks:**
- Define `Song` TypeScript interface extending `Exercise`
- Create `SongLoader` service (download + cache + offline)
- Add `songProgress` to `progressStore` (per-layer mastery)
- Create Firestore schema for songs collection
- **Prerequisite:** Phase 4 (Firebase Auth) for user-specific data

### 3B. MIDI Pipeline — Bootstrap 100+ Songs (~10 days)

**Source:** Public domain MIDI files (Mutopia, IMSLP, Musescore community)

**Pipeline:**
1. Parse MIDI files → extract melody + left hand tracks
2. Quantize to beat grid, normalize tempo
3. Convert to Exercise JSON format (note, startBeat, durationBeats)
4. Auto-generate difficulty ratings based on note density/range/rhythm complexity
5. Create 3 layers per song: melody-only → left-hand → full arrangement
6. Quality review (reject poorly quantized or overly complex arrangements)

**Genre Distribution (100 songs):**
| Genre | Count | Examples |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Classical | 25 | Fur Elise, Moonlight Sonata, Canon in D |
| Pop/Rock | 25 | Let It Be, Imagine, Bohemian Rhapsody |
| Film/TV | 15 | Star Wars, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones |
| Jazz Standards | 10 | Fly Me to the Moon, Autumn Leaves |
| Folk/Traditional | 10 | Greensleeves, Amazing Grace |
| Video Games | 10 | Mario, Zelda, Tetris |
| Holiday | 5 | Jingle Bells, Silent Night |

**Key Tasks:**
- Build MIDI parser script (Python or Node)
- Create quality validation pipeline
- Generate Exercise JSON for each layer
- Upload to Firebase Storage with metadata
- **Effort:** 8-10 days (bulk processing + manual QA)

### 3C. Music Library UI (~5 days)

**Browse Screen (new tab or section):**
- Genre carousel (horizontal scroll)
- Song cards with album art, difficulty badge, play count
- Search with filters (genre, difficulty, duration)
- "New This Week" / "Trending" / "Staff Picks" sections

**Song Detail Screen:**
- Album art hero
- Layer selector (Melody / Left Hand / Full Arrangement)
- Mastery progress per layer (star display)
- Play button → ExercisePlayer with selected layer
- Community stats (plays, average score)

**Key Tasks:**
- Create `MusicLibraryScreen` (browse + search)
- Create `SongDetailScreen` (layer selection + mastery)
- Add "Music" tab to bottom navigation
- Wire to ExercisePlayer for playback
- **Files:** New screens + AppNavigator update

### 3D. Gamification Layer (~5 days)

**Mastery Tiers per Song:**
| Tier | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Bronze | Complete melody layer (any score) |
| Silver | 3-star melody + complete left hand |
| Gold | 3-star both layers + complete full arrangement |
| Platinum | 3-star all three layers |

**Weekly Challenges:**
- "Play 5 Classical songs" → bonus XP
- "Master 3 songs this week" → special badge
- Challenge rotation via Firebase Remote Config

**Collections:**
- "80s Pop Hits" — complete 5/10 songs to earn collection badge
- "Movie Magic" — film theme collection
- Auto-generated based on genre/era groupings

**Leaderboards (optional, Phase 5):**
- Weekly top scorers per song
- Monthly XP leaderboard
- Friends leaderboard (requires social features)

### 3E. Community Arrangements (Future — Post-Launch)

**Arrangement Editor:**
- Web-based MIDI editor for creating song arrangements
- Submit for review → approved arrangements appear in library
- Creator attribution + play count stats

**Cost Estimate:**
- MIDI processing pipeline: ~$0 (public domain sources)
- Firebase Storage: ~$5/month for 100 songs
- Firestore reads: ~$10/month at 1K DAU
- Total Phase 3 infrastructure: ~$15/month

**Total estimated effort: ~40-45 working days**

### Critical Path

The fastest path to App Store launch:
1. **Phase 2 remaining** (3-5 days) — complete the core learning experience
2. **Phase 5A** (2 days) — dev build, because native MIDI + audio require it
3. **Phase 4** (3 days) — auth + sync, required for user data persistence
4. **Phase 3A-C** (20 days) — Music Library core (minimum viable library)
5. **Phase 5B-E** (5 days) — launch prep

**MVP Launch (without Music Library): ~13 days**
This gives you a fully functional 6-lesson learning app with gamification.

**Full Launch (with Music Library): ~40 days**
Complete experience with 100+ songs, mastery tiers, and challenges.

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Song storage | Firebase Storage (JSON) | Cheaper than Firestore for large exercise data |
| Song metadata | Firestore | Real-time queries, search, sorting |
| Local caching | AsyncStorage + file system | Offline-first for downloaded songs |
| MIDI pipeline | Node.js scripts | Same TS tooling as the app |
| Community arrangements | Web editor (future) | Separate from mobile app complexity |
| Leaderboards | Firestore + Cloud Functions | Real-time updates, server-side validation |

## Monthly Cost Projections

| Scale | Firebase | Gemini AI | Total |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 100 DAU | ~$5 | ~$6 | ~$11/mo |
| 1K DAU | ~$25 | ~$30 | ~$55/mo |
| 10K DAU | ~$150 | ~$150 | ~$300/mo |

All within Firebase free tier for initial launch. Gemini costs assume 80% cache hit rate.
