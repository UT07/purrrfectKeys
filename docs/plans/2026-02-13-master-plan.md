---

## Phase 3: Firebase Auth + Sync (~3 days)

**Why now:** Prerequisite for Adaptive Learning (student profiles), Music Library (user-specific data), and any cloud features. Must happen before Phases 4-5.

> **Note:** Auth screens, session persistence, navigation guards, SyncManager, display name sync all complete. Remaining: wire sync to exercise completion, data migration, integration verification.

### 3A. Firebase Authentication — DONE
- Email/password + Google Sign-In
- Anonymous auth for try-before-signup (convert to full account later)
- Wire to existing Firebase config (`src/services/firebase/`)
- Auth state persistence (stay logged in across app restarts)

### 3B. Progress Cloud Sync — IN PROGRESS (SyncManager done, wiring remaining)
- Sync `progressStore` to Firestore on changes
- Conflict resolution: latest-write-wins with timestamp
- Offline queue for pending changes (sync when back online)
- Sync on app launch + periodic background sync
- Merge strategy: local progress + cloud progress → pick higher scores

### 3C. User Profile — DONE
- Display name, avatar selection, joined date
- Public profile with stats (optional)
- Account deletion (GDPR/App Store requirement)
- Wire into ProfileScreen

**Key Files:**
- `src/services/firebase/auth.ts` — new
- `src/services/firebase/syncService.ts` — new
- `src/stores/authStore.ts` — new Zustand store
- `src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` — modify

## Phase 4: Adaptive Learning System — SUPERSEDED

> **This phase has been merged into the Gamification + Adaptive Learning + UI Overhaul sprint.** See `docs/plans/2026-02-16-gamification-adaptive-design.md` for the expanded design covering cat companions, AI exercise generation, split keyboard, Duolingo-style UI polish, and expanded achievements.

**Full design:** `docs/plans/2026-02-13-adaptive-learning-design.md`

Transform KeySense from a linear exercise sequence into a personalized, AI-driven learning experience where every student gets a unique curriculum.

### 4A. Challenge Infrastructure (3-4 days)
- `ChallengeGenerator.ts` — Gemini generates fresh exercise JSON personalized to student
- `ChallengeValidator.ts` — Safety layer rejects invalid AI output (MIDI range, scoring config, note count)
- 3 fallback templates per lesson (18 total) for offline/failure
- Add `"type": "challenge"` to Exercise type
- Wire challenge generation into ExercisePlayer
- Challenge completion tracking in progressStore

### 4B. Student Skill Model (2-3 days)
- `StudentModel.ts` — Per-skill mastery tracking (22 skills from lesson metadata)
- `DifficultyTuner.ts` — Adaptive params (tempo, timing tolerance, passing score, hint level)
- Mastery update rules: diminishing returns, time-based decay, confidence scoring
- Persist to progressStore + sync to Firestore

### 4C. Dynamic Curriculum (3-4 days)
- `CurriculumEngine.ts` — Goal-based ordering (songs/technique/exploration paths)
- `LessonFlowController.ts` — Orchestrates exercise → exercise → challenge → exercise sequence
- Update LevelMapScreen to show challenge nodes
- Unlock logic: all regular exercises + all challenges passed → next lesson

**Key decisions (from brainstorming):**
- Play-based challenges (not text quizzes)
- Gemini generates full exercise JSON
- Challenges sprinkled every 2 exercises
- Full personalization: adaptive difficulty + goal paths + AI ordering

---

## Phase 5: Social & Advanced Gamification (~10-15 days)

**Runs in parallel with Phase 6 (Music Library).** Both phases can start after Adaptive Learning is complete since they're independent.

### 5A. Community & Social (5-7 days)
- **Friends system:** Add friends via username/link, see their progress
- **Activity feed:** "Alex just completed Lesson 4!" — social proof and motivation
- **Challenges between friends:** "Beat my score on Fur Elise" — push notifications
- **Share achievements:** Export achievement cards to social media (Instagram Stories, etc.)
- **Firestore schema:** `users/{uid}/friends`, `activityFeed` collection with fan-out

### 5B. Leagues & Leaderboards (3-4 days)
- **Weekly leagues:** Bronze → Silver → Gold → Diamond (Duolingo-style promotion/demotion)
- **League placement:** Based on weekly XP earned
- **Leaderboard UI:** Ranked list with avatar, XP, streak
- **Promotion/demotion:** Top 10 promote, bottom 5 demote
- **Cloud Functions:** Weekly league reset, rank calculation
- **Firestore schema:** `leagues/{leagueId}/members`, sorted by weeklyXp

### 5C. Awards & Achievements System (2-3 days)
- **Achievement badges:** 30+ unlockable badges (First Note, 7-Day Streak, Perfect Score, etc.)
- **Badge categories:** Milestone, Skill, Social, Challenge, Hidden
- **Achievement gallery:** Dedicated screen showing all badges (earned = color, locked = grey)
- **Push notifications:** Celebrate rare achievements
- **Firestore schema:** `users/{uid}/achievements` with timestamps

### 5D. Gifts & Rewards (1-2 days)
- **Daily login rewards:** Escalating XP bonuses for consecutive days
- **Streak rewards:** Special badges/bonuses at 7, 30, 100, 365 day streaks
- **Streak freeze:** Spend XP to protect streak (max 2 freezes banked)
- **Gift system:** Send encouragement/virtual gifts to friends
- **Premium path (future):** Cosmetic rewards, custom Keysie outfits

**Key dependencies:** Requires Phase 3 (Auth) for user identity. Can run in parallel with Music Library.

```
Song
├── Metadata (title, artist, genre, difficulty, duration, album art)
├── Layers
│   ├── melody (right hand only) — Exercise JSON
│   ├── leftHand (left hand only) — Exercise JSON
│   └── fullArrangement (both hands) — Exercise JSON
├── Community fields (plays, ratings, arrangements)
└── Mastery tracking (per-layer star ratings)
```

**Storage Plan:**

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Audio engine | react-native-audio-api + ExpoAudioEngine fallback | JSI-based low latency, graceful degradation |
| Song storage | Firebase Storage (JSON) | Cheaper than Firestore for large exercise data |
| Song metadata | Firestore | Real-time queries, search, sorting |
| Local caching | AsyncStorage + file system | Offline-first for downloaded songs |
| MIDI pipeline | Node.js scripts | Same TS tooling as the app |
| AI challenges | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Fast, cheap, sufficient for JSON generation |
| Community arrangements | Web editor (future) | Separate from mobile app complexity |
| Leaderboards | Firestore + Cloud Functions | Real-time updates, server-side validation |

## Monthly Cost Projections

| Scale | Firebase | Gemini AI | Total |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 100 DAU | ~$5 | ~$6 | ~$11/mo |
| 1K DAU | ~$25 | ~$30 | ~$55/mo |
| 10K DAU | ~$150 | ~$150 | ~$300/mo |

All within Firebase free tier for initial launch. Gemini costs assume 80% cache hit rate.
