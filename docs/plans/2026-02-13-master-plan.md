---

## Next Up: Gameplay UX Rework

User tested on iPhone 13 Pro and identified critical UX issues with the exercise gameplay.

### Changes Planned
| Change | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Notes flow **top-to-bottom** (not left-to-right) | Industry standard (Synthesia, Simply Piano, Piano Tiles), natural gravity feel |
| Piano keyboard at **bottom**, zoomed to 1-2 relevant octaves | Bigger, tappable keys instead of full 88-key range |
| **Smart octave selection** per exercise | Auto-detect needed range, only render those keys |
| Two-hand play: combined range at bottom with left/right zone divider | Maintains real-piano spatial mapping |

### Why NOT left/right edge keys (discussed & rejected)
- Breaks piano spatial mapping (keys run left-to-right on real pianos)
- Black keys have no natural position on vertical edge strips
- Two-hand split inverts muscle memory (thumbs wrong direction)

---

## Phase 5: Game Feel & Polish (PLANNED)

Separate phase, not blocking priority features. Can run in parallel with or after the gameplay UX rework.

| Area | What | Inspiration |
|------|------|-------------|
| Pre-Level Screen | Fun fact + animated mascot + countdown before each exercise | Duolingo lesson intros |
| Avatars | Actual Rive .riv animation files for all 8 cats | Subway Surfers characters |
| Progression Feel | Animated XP bar, level-up celebrations, streak animations | Duolingo XP system |
| Transitions | Screen transitions with personality (slide/bounce/fade) | Duolingo's smooth flow |
| Micro-interactions | Button press animations, haptic patterns, sound effects | Subway Surfers UI |

---

## Phase 6: Social & Advanced Gamification (PLANNED)

### 6A. Community & Social
- Friends system, activity feed, friend challenges, share achievements

### 6B. Leagues & Leaderboards
- Weekly leagues (Bronze → Diamond), promotion/demotion, ranked list

### 6C. Awards & Achievements System
- 30+ unlockable badges, badge gallery, push notifications

### 6D. Gifts & Rewards
- Daily login rewards, streak rewards, streak freeze, gift system

---

## Phase 7: Music Library (DESIGNED)

### 7A. Data Model & Infrastructure
- Song format extending Exercise JSON with layers (melody, leftHand, fullArrangement)

### 7B. MIDI Pipeline — 100+ Songs
- Public domain MIDI → Exercise JSON pipeline (Classical, Pop, Film, Jazz, Folk, Games, Holiday)

### 7C. Music Library UI
- Browse screen with genre carousel, song cards, search/filters

### 7D. Music Gamification
- Mastery tiers per song (Bronze→Platinum), weekly challenges, collections

---

## Phase 7.5: Pre-Launch QA Sprint (PLANNED)

Comprehensive testing before App Store submission. Covers all aspects of the app.

| Area | Tests | Pass Criteria |
|------|-------|---------------|
| AI Coach Quality | 20 exercises scored, review feedback quality | 80%+ feedback rated "helpful" by tester |
| AI Exercise Generation | Generate 50 exercises, validate musicality | No broken exercises, difficulty matches profile |
| Performance | Profile on iPhone 13 Pro + low-end Android | <20ms touch-to-sound, 60fps PianoRoll, <2s screen load |
| Gamification | Full lesson 1-6 playthrough + mastery tests | Progression feels fair, XP/streaks correct |
| UI/UX | All screens walkthrough, both orientations | No broken layouts, consistent theme, accessible |
| Content | Validate all 30+ exercises | No wrong notes, smooth difficulty curve |
| Offline | Full session without network | Core loop works, sync resumes on reconnect |
| Edge Cases | Kill mid-exercise, rapid navigation, etc. | No crashes, state recovery |
| Demo Mode | Test on all 6 lessons | Demo plays correctly, ghost notes work, auto-fade triggers |

---

## Phase 8: App Store Launch (PLANNED)

| Task | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| Build finalization | EAS Build, native MIDI, code signing |
| Performance optimization | Profile, fix jank, reduce bundle size |
| App Store assets | Icon, screenshots, description, privacy policy |
| Beta testing | TestFlight + Internal Testing |
| Launch | Submit to stores, monitor crashes |

---

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Audio engine | react-native-audio-api + ExpoAudioEngine fallback | JSI-based low latency, graceful degradation |
| AI challenges | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Fast, cheap, sufficient for JSON generation |
| Avatar animation | rive-react-native (legacy) | Rive-first with SVG fallback; new Nitro needs SDK 53+ |
| State management | Zustand v5 with MMKV persistence | Simple, performant, TypeScript-first |
| Scoring model | 5-factor weighted (accuracy 35%, timing 30%, duration 15%, completeness 10%, extra notes 10%) | Balanced for piano learning |

## Monthly Cost Projections

| Scale | Firebase | Gemini AI | Total |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 100 DAU | ~$5 | ~$6 | ~$11/mo |
| 1K DAU | ~$25 | ~$30 | ~$55/mo |
| 10K DAU | ~$150 | ~$150 | ~$300/mo |
