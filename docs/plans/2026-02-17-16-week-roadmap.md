---

## Phase 5: Adaptive Learning Revamp (Weeks 1-3) -- COMPLETED Feb 20, 2026

**Status:** All 18 tasks (5.1-5.18) across 7 batches DONE. ~150+ new tests (exceeded ~80+ estimate). 75 suites, 1,725 tests total.

**Core Principle:** The AI IS the piano teacher — not a background service. Salsa (cat coach) should feel like a real vocal instructor who knows you personally.

### Week 1 — Curriculum Engine + AI From Day 1

| # | Task | Description | Est |
|---|------|-------------|-----|
| 5.1 | SkillTree data model | Define skill tree: notes → scales → chords → songs → improv. Each node has prerequisites, target exercises, mastery threshold. Pure TS in `src/core/curriculum/` | 3h |
| 5.2 | CurriculumEngine service | AI-powered session planner. Takes LearnerProfile + SkillTree → picks today's exercises (mix of weak spots + new material + variety). Replaces static lesson ordering with dynamic paths | 4h |
| 5.3 | Rewire GeminiExerciseService | Expand from random generation to curriculum-aware. Accept skill tree node context, difficulty curve position, target skills. Generate exercises that teach specific concepts, not just random notes | 3h |
| 5.4 | AI exercise integration from Day 1 | After skill assessment, AI immediately tailors first exercises. Current 6 lessons become "anchor lessons" at milestones. Gap between anchors filled by AI | 4h |
| 5.5 | Daily session screen | New "Today's Practice" screen replacing static lesson list on HomeScreen. Shows AI-picked session: warm-up → lesson/drill → challenge. Explains WHY each exercise was chosen | 4h |
| 5.6 | Tests for Week 1 | CurriculumEngine tests, GeminiExerciseService expanded tests, integration tests | 3h |

### Week 2 — Voice Coaching Pipeline

| # | Task | Description | Est |
|---|------|-------------|-----|
| 5.7 | VoiceCoachingService | Gemini generates coaching text from LearnerProfile + ExerciseScore. System prompt encodes Salsa's personality (sassy, encouraging, SPECIFIC). "Your C-D transition was 120ms late" not "try again" | 4h |
| 5.8 | TTS integration | Expo Speech API as baseline (free, instant). Interface abstraction for future ElevenLabs upgrade. Per-cat voice settings (pitch, rate adjustments) | 3h |
| 5.9 | CompletionModal voice coaching | After exercise: Salsa speaks personalized feedback. Visual speech bubble + audio. Highest-impact touchpoint | 3h |
| 5.10 | Pre-exercise coaching | Brief voice tip before exercise starts: "Focus on your left hand this time" / "This one targets your weak F#" | 2h |
| 5.11 | Coaching text quality | Gemini prompt engineering for teacher-quality output. A/B test prompt variants. Cache coaching for offline replay | 3h |
| 5.12 | Tests for Week 2 | VoiceCoachingService tests, TTS mock tests, CompletionModal integration | 3h |

### Week 3 — Weak Spot Detection + Free Play Analysis

| # | Task | Description | Est |
|---|------|-------------|-----|
| 5.13 | Weak spot drill generator | AI detects struggling patterns (not just weak notes — timing issues, hand transitions, tempo drops). Auto-generates targeted 30-second drills | 4h |
| 5.14 | Progressive difficulty engine | AI gradually increases tempo, adds notes, introduces hand independence based on mastery. No sudden difficulty spikes | 3h |
| 5.15 | FreePlayAnalyzer service | Captures notes played during free play. After user stops (2s silence): analyzes key/scale, identifies patterns, suggests exercises. "Want me to create a drill for that C→B transition?" | 4h |
| 5.16 | Free play coaching UI | Free play mode with floating Salsa. Post-play feedback card with analysis + "Generate drill" CTA | 3h |
| 5.17 | Offline coaching fallback | 50+ pre-generated coaching templates for common scenarios (perfect score, just missed, specific weak areas). Used when Gemini unavailable | 2h |
| 5.18 | Tests + integration | End-to-end: play exercise → get voice feedback → AI picks next exercise → difficulty adjusts. Free play analysis tests | 4h |

### Phase 5 Exit Criteria
- [x] AI picks exercises from Day 1 (no more "finish 6 lessons first")
- [x] Voice coaching speaks after every exercise with specific feedback
- [x] Free play mode with post-play analysis and drill generation
- [x] 365-day content framework operational (skill tree + AI generation)
- [x] ~80+ new tests (actual: ~150+ new tests)

### Phase 5.2: 365-Day Curriculum Expansion (completed Feb 20)

Expanded the adaptive learning system to support a full year of daily practice:

- **SkillTree:** 27 → 100 nodes across 15 tiers (12 categories including black-keys, key-signatures, expression, arpeggios, sight-reading)
- **Skill decay:** 14-day half-life linear model, 0.5 threshold triggers review sessions
- **Multi-session mastery:** `requiredCompletions` field (1-5) — harder skills need multiple successful sessions
- **Session types:** `selectSessionType()` returns new-material / review / challenge / mixed based on decay state and exercise count
- **AI-only tiers 7-15:** No static JSON exercises; CurriculumEngine generates AI exercises via Gemini for all 73 new skill nodes
- **UI updates:** DailySessionScreen session type badge + decay count indicator; LevelMap tier section headers
- **Tests:** 31 new tests (SkillDecay, SessionTypes, yearLongProgression simulation)
- **Docs:** stabilization-report.md trimmed from 795 → 105 lines (full archive preserved)

---

## Phase 6: Avatar Evolution & Gamification (Weeks 4-6)

**Core Concept:** Pokemon-style cat evolution with gameplay-relevant abilities. Dual currency: XP (progression/evolution) + Gems (purchasing/unlocking).

### Currency System

| Currency | Earned From | Used For |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **XP** | Completing exercises, daily goals, streaks | Level progression, cat evolution stages |
