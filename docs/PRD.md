## 1. Product Vision

Purrrfect Keys is the Duolingo of piano — an AI-powered mobile app that teaches anyone to play piano through bite-sized, gamified practice sessions guided by a personal cat coach named Salsa.

**One-liner:** Learn piano with an AI cat teacher who knows your weaknesses, evolves with you, and makes practice feel like a game.

**Core promise:** Open the app → get a personalized 5-minute practice session → feel progress → come back tomorrow.

### Secondary: Lapsed Players (20%)

## 3. Core Experience

### 3.1 The Daily Loop

```
Open App → Salsa greets you → "Today's Practice" (5-10 min)
  ├── Warm-up (review decayed skill)
  ├── New material (next skill tree node)
  └── Challenge (slightly above current level)
→ Score + Coaching → XP + Gems → Cat Evolution → Come back tomorrow
```

### 3.2 Salsa — The AI Coach

Salsa is a grey cat with green eyes who serves as the user's personal piano teacher. She is NOT a background service or an afterthought — she IS the app's personality.

**Salsa's role:**
- Greets the user by name on the home screen with context-aware messages
- Picks each practice session and explains WHY ("Your C-D transitions have been shaky lately")
- Coaches during exercises with real-time reactions (bounce on perfect, droop on miss)
- Gives specific, actionable post-exercise feedback ("Beat 3 was 120ms late — try counting out loud")
- Speaks via TTS with her unique voice (pitch/rate tuned for her personality)
- Evolves visually as the user progresses (Baby → Teen → Adult → Master)
- Has personality traits: encouraging but honest, a little sassy, celebrates small wins

**Salsa is always visible:** Home screen (large), exercise player (buddy), completion screen, daily session, profile. She's the face of the app.

### 3.3 Cat Evolution System

Evolution is NOT cosmetic — it reflects the learner's real progress:

| Stage | XP Required | Meaning | Visual Change |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Baby | 0 | Just started | Small, simple, big eyes |
| Teen | 500 | Committed learner | Slightly larger, more expressive |
| Adult | 2,000 | Intermediate player | Full-size, confident pose |
| Master | 5,000 | Advanced player | Glowing aura, accessories |

**Evolution reveal:** Full-screen Pokemon-style animation when the cat evolves. This is a major moment — not a toast notification.

**Abilities:** Each evolution stage unlocks a gameplay ability (wider timing window, combo shield, XP multiplier, etc.). These make the game feel easier as the player improves, creating a positive feedback loop.

### 3.4 Gem Economy

| Source | Amount | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| First exercise completion | 25 | Once per exercise |
| Score 90%+ | 5 | Per attempt |
| Perfect score (100%) | 15 | Per attempt |
| 7-day streak | 50 | Weekly |
| 30-day streak | 200 | Monthly |
| Daily challenge | 20 | Daily |

**Spending:** Unlock new cats (500-2000 gems). Future: cosmetics, themes.

## 7. Current State (Feb 21, 2026)

**Completed:** Phases 1-6 (Core Loop, Gamification, Auth, Adaptive Learning, Avatar Evolution)
**Codebase:** 84 test suites, 1,991 tests, 0 TypeScript errors
**Next:** Phase 7 (UI Revamp + Game Feel & Polish) — the app is functional but needs industry-standard visual quality

**Key gap:** The app currently looks and feels like a well-built prototype, not a polished consumer product. Phase 7 addresses this with a comprehensive UI revamp targeting Duolingo-level visual quality.

## 8. Competitive Landscape

| App | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|-----|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Simply Piano | Mic detection, song library | Generic, no personality, expensive | AI personalization, cat companions, free |
| Flowkey | Beautiful UI, real songs | No gamification, passive learning | Active gameplay, evolution system |
| Duolingo (model) | Gamification gold standard | Not for piano | We apply their engagement model to piano |
| Piano Marvel | MIDI support, sight-reading | Desktop-focused, dated UI | Mobile-first, modern design |

**Our moat:** The combination of AI-adaptive curriculum + character-driven gamification doesn't exist in piano learning apps today.
