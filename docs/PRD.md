# Purrrfect Keys — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 4.0
**Last Updated:** March 3, 2026
**Author:** Product Team
**Status:** Phase 11A — Making existing app work on device (Phases 1-10.5 code complete, device verification in progress)

---

## 1. Product Vision

Purrrfect Keys is the Duolingo of piano — an AI-powered mobile app that teaches anyone to play piano through bite-sized, gamified practice sessions guided by a personal cat coach named Salsa.

**One-liner:** Learn piano with an AI cat teacher who knows your weaknesses, evolves with you, and makes practice feel like a game.

**Core promise:** Open the app → get a personalized 5-minute practice session → feel progress → come back tomorrow.

### Secondary: Lapsed Players (20%)

## 3. Core Experience

### 3.1 The Daily Loop

```
Open App → Salsa greets you → "Today's Practice" (5-10 min)
  ├── Warm-up (review decayed skill)
  ├── New material (next skill tree node)
  └── Challenge (slightly above current level)
→ Score + Coaching → XP + Gems → Cat Evolution → Come back tomorrow
```

### 3.2 Salsa — The AI Coach

Salsa is a grey cat with green eyes who serves as the user's personal piano teacher. She is NOT a background service or an afterthought — she IS the app's personality.

**Salsa's role:**
- Greets the user by name on the home screen with context-aware messages
- Picks each practice session and explains WHY ("Your C-D transitions have been shaky lately")
- Coaches during exercises with real-time reactions (bounce on perfect, droop on miss)
- Gives specific, actionable post-exercise feedback ("Beat 3 was 120ms late — try counting out loud")
- Speaks via TTS with her unique voice (pitch/rate tuned for her personality)
- Evolves visually as the user progresses (Baby → Teen → Adult → Master)
- Has personality traits: encouraging but honest, a little sassy, celebrates small wins

**Salsa is always visible:** Home screen (large), exercise player (buddy), completion screen, daily session, profile. She's the face of the app.

### 3.3 Cat Evolution System

Evolution is NOT cosmetic — it reflects the learner's real progress:

| Stage | XP Required | Meaning | Visual Change |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Baby | 0 | Just started | Small, simple, big eyes |
| Teen | 500 | Committed learner | Slightly larger, more expressive |
| Adult | 2,000 | Intermediate player | Full-size, confident pose |
| Master | 5,000 | Advanced player | Glowing aura, accessories |

**Evolution reveal:** Full-screen Pokemon-style animation when the cat evolves. This is a major moment — not a toast notification.

**Abilities:** Each evolution stage unlocks a gameplay ability (wider timing window, combo shield, XP multiplier, etc.). These make the game feel easier as the player improves, creating a positive feedback loop.

### 3.4 Gem Economy

| Source | Amount | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| First exercise completion | 25 | Once per exercise |
| Score 90%+ | 5 | Per attempt |
| Perfect score (100%) | 15 | Per attempt |
| 7-day streak | 50 | Weekly |
| 30-day streak | 200 | Monthly |
| Daily challenge | 20 | Daily |

**Spending:** Unlock new cats (500-2000 gems). Future: cosmetics, themes.

## 7. Current State (March 3, 2026)

**Code Complete:** Phases 1-10.5 (all features coded and passing in Jest/simulator)
**Device-Verified:** Phases 1-3 partially (sign-in tested on device), all others simulator-only
**Broken on Device:** Phase 8 mic input (ONNX crash), Phase 10.5 social (Firebase not deployed)
**Eliminated:** 3D cat rendering (GL context issues, replaced with premium SVG plan)
**In Progress:** Phase 11A — Make existing app work on physical device
**Codebase:** 129 test suites, 2,717 tests, 0 TypeScript errors
**Content:** 36 static exercises across 6 lessons, AI generation for tiers 7-15, 124 songs in Firestore
**Audio:** Synthetic oscillator sounds (no real piano samples yet)

**Key blockers:**
1. IPA build fails (missing `EXPO_TOKEN` in GitHub secrets)
2. Mic input crashes on device (ONNX native module not in standard build)
3. Firebase Cloud Functions/rules/indexes not deployed (social features dead)
4. No real piano sounds (synthetic beeps only)
5. Zero .wav/.mp3 sound assets in repo

**Strategy shift (March 3):** Stop building new features. Fix the foundation first. Full plan in `docs/plans/UNIFIED-PLAN.md`.

## 8. Competitive Landscape

| App | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|-----|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Simply Piano | Mic detection, song library | Generic, no personality, expensive | AI personalization, cat companions, free |
| Flowkey | Beautiful UI, real songs | No gamification, passive learning | Active gameplay, evolution system |
| Duolingo (model) | Gamification gold standard | Not for piano | We apply their engagement model to piano |
| Piano Marvel | MIDI support, sight-reading | Desktop-focused, dated UI | Mobile-first, modern design |

**Our moat:** The combination of AI-adaptive curriculum + character-driven gamification doesn't exist in piano learning apps today.
