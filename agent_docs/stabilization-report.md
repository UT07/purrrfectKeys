- **Glow utilities:** GLOW object + `glowColor()` helper function

#### Batch 2: Bug Fixes
- **Chonky Monke unlock bug:** Added `validateOwnedCats()` to hydration — legendary cats stripped if unlock conditions not met
- **CatAvatar mood:** Now accepts `mood` prop (was hardcoded to 'encouraging')
- **MascotBubble:** Now accepts optional `catId` prop to render user's selected cat

#### Batch 3: Cat Avatar Architecture Overhaul
- **Composable SVG parts:** CatParts.tsx with CatBody (4 shapes), CatHead, CatEars (3 variants), CatEyes (4 variants), CatMouth, CatTail (3 variants), CatWhiskers, CatNose
- **Per-cat profiles:** catProfiles.ts maps each cat ID to unique body/ears/eyes/tail/cheekFluff/blush combination
- **Accessories:** CatAccessories.tsx renders evolution-stage accessories (BowTie, Sunglasses, Fedora, Crown, Cape, Monocle)
- **KeysieSvg rewrite:** Composable renderer using profiles + parts, backward compatible

- **Tests:** 88 suites, 2,064 tests, 0 failures

### Gem Bug Fix + Cat Gallery Redesign (Feb 23)

#### Gem Redemption Bug Fix (Workstream 1)
- **Root cause:** Race condition between `completeDailyChallenge()` and `claimDailyReward()` — 500ms debounced save could lose `lastDailyChallengeDate` before HomeScreen reads it
- **`createImmediateSave`:** New persistence utility in `persistence.ts` — same API as `createDebouncedSave` but with 0ms delay for critical state
- **`completeDailyChallenge()` fix:** Now uses `immediateSave(get())` instead of `debouncedSave(get())` ensuring `lastDailyChallengeDate` persists before user leaves ExercisePlayer
- **`completeDailyChallengeAndClaim()`:** New combined action that marks challenge complete + auto-claims today's reward in one atomic operation, removing friction of finding the DailyRewardCalendar cell manually
- **Claim failure toast:** HomeScreen shows "Complete today's challenge first!" when manual claim fails (auto-dismiss 2.5s)
- **DailyChallengeCard reward display:** Shows "+X gems claimed!" when reward has been collected (instead of just "Completed!")

#### Cat Gallery Redesign (Workstream 2)
- **Unified gallery:** Merged `CatSwitchScreen` + `CatCollectionScreen` into single swipeable gallery (`CatSwitchScreen.tsx`)
- **Card layout:** 88% screen width (up from 78%) — large KeysieSvg avatar (140px), evolution stage badge, name/personality, music skill, evolution progress bar (XP to next stage), 4 ability icons, action button
- **Ability display:** `AbilityIconRow` with stage-based lock badges; tappable to expand inline `AbilityDetail` (name + description + unlock stage)
- **Buy flow modal:** Styled `BuyModal` replacing `Alert.alert` — shows cat preview, gem cost, balance, confirm/cancel with haptic feedback
- **Action button states:** "Select" (owned), "Selected" (current), "Unlock for X gems" (purchasable), "Legendary" (Chonky Monké)
- **Navigation consolidation:** `CatCollection` route now renders `CatSwitchScreen`; `CatCollectionScreen.tsx` deprecated
- **Gem balance header:** Shows current gem count in gallery header

- **Tests:** 90 suites, 2,135 tests, 0 failures

### Cat Gallery Sneak Peek, Enhanced Challenges, Tier Reorder (Feb 23)

#### Cat Gallery Sneak Peek
- **Locked cats now show actual avatar:** Replaced blank lock circle with dimmed (opacity 0.4) KeysieSvg + lock badge overlay
- Users can now see what each locked cat looks like before purchasing

#### Tier Reordering
- **Songs moved from tier 6 to tier 10:** Songs at tier 6 was too early since Music Library is planned. Black Keys and theory content now come first.
- **New tier order:** 1-Note Finding, 2-Right Hand, 3-Left Hand, 4-Both Hands, 5-Scales, 6-Black Keys, 7-G&F Major, 8-Minor Keys, 9-Chords, 10-Songs, 11-Rhythm, 12-Arpeggios, 13-Expression, 14-Sight Reading, 15-Performance
- Updated SkillTree.ts (40+ nodes reordered), LevelMapScreen TIER_META/TIER_CAT_COMPANIONS, TierIntroScreen TIER_META/MASCOT_MESSAGES
- DAG validation: all 31 SkillTree tests pass (no circular deps, all prereqs point to lower tiers)

#### Enhanced Challenge System
- **New file: `src/core/challenges/challengeSystem.ts`** — Pure TypeScript challenge engine
  - 7 daily challenge types: any-exercise, specific-category, score-threshold, combo-streak, speed-run, perfect-notes, practice-minutes
  - Deterministic date-hash selection: ~40% category-specific, ~60% template-based
  - Weekly bonus challenge: one random day per week, harder thresholds (90% score, 10-note combo), 50 gems + 3x XP
  - Monthly challenge: one random day per month, 3-5 exercises in 48h window, 150 gems + 3x XP
  - All generators are deterministic from date strings (no randomness)
- **DailyChallengeCard updated:** Now shows specific challenge label, icon, description, and gem reward (was generic motivational text)
- **New components:** WeeklyChallengeCard (gold/crimson, crown icon, only visible on challenge day), MonthlyChallengeCard (purple, progress bar, 48h countdown)
- **HomeScreen wiring:** Weekly + monthly cards render below daily challenge (auto-hide when not active)
- **progressStore updated:** `recordExerciseCompletion` now accepts optional `ExerciseChallengeContext` for challenge validation (score, maxCombo, perfectNotes, playbackSpeed, category, minutesPracticedToday)
- **ExercisePlayer updated:** Constructs challenge context from score details (computes maxCombo from consecutive correct notes, looks up SkillTree category)
- **23 new tests** for challengeSystem (determinism, variety, all validation types)

- **Tests:** 94 suites, 2,243 tests, 0 failures

### Phase 8: Audio Input — Mic Pipeline (Feb 23)

#### Batch 8A: Core Pitch Detection
- **YINPitchDetector (PitchDetector.ts):** Pure TS YIN algorithm with pre-allocated buffers, parabolic interpolation, configurable frequency range (50-2000Hz)
- **NoteTracker:** Hysteresis layer — 40ms onset hold, 80ms release hold prevents rapid note flickering
- **AudioCapture (AudioCapture.ts):** react-native-audio-api AudioRecorder wrapper with buffer streaming callbacks
- **MicrophoneInput (MicrophoneInput.ts):** Composes AudioCapture + YINPitchDetector + NoteTracker → MidiNoteEvent (same interface as MIDI)
- **pitchUtils (src/core/music/pitchUtils.ts):** frequencyToNearestMidi, frequencyCentsOffset

#### Batch 8B: InputManager & Exercise Integration
- **InputManager (src/input/InputManager.ts):** Unified input factory — auto-detects MIDI > Mic > Touch, runtime method switching
- **Timing compensation:** Per-method latency: MIDI=0ms, Touch=20ms, Mic=100ms. Mic gets 1.5x timing tolerance multiplier
- **useExercisePlayback:** Fully integrated with InputManager — initializes preferred input, subscribes to events, compensates latency in scoring
- **settingsStore:** Added `preferredInputMethod` ('auto'|'midi'|'mic'|'touch') + `setPreferredInputMethod()`

#### Batch 8C: MicSetupScreen & Settings
- **MicSetupScreen:** Permission wizard (intro → requesting → granted/denied), privacy assurance, tip card
- **ProfileScreen:** Input method selector in settings section

#### Batch 8D: Onboarding & Free Play Integration
- **Onboarding Step 3 redesigned:** "How Will You Play?" with 3 options (MIDI / Microphone / On-Screen Keyboard), replaces old binary MIDI Yes/No
- **Post-onboarding mic setup:** Users who choose mic are navigated to MicSetupScreen after onboarding completes
- **PlayScreen (Free Play):** InputManager wired for mic/MIDI input alongside touch keyboard. Active input badge shows current method. Instructions adapt to input method.
- **Playback speed defaults:** MIDI=1.0x, Mic=0.75x, Touch=0.5x

- **Tests:** 94 suites, 2,243 tests, 0 failures

### Phase 9: Music Library (Feb 24)

#### Code (11 Batches — merged to master)
- **Song types + ABC parser:** `songTypes.ts`, `abcParser.ts` (via `abcjs`), `songMastery.ts`
- **Firestore service:** `songService.ts` — songs collection CRUD + per-user mastery subcollection + rate limiting
- **Gemini generation:** `songGenerationService.ts` → extracted pure functions to `songAssembler.ts` for Node.js script reuse
- **Song store:** `songStore.ts` — Zustand with persistence, filters, pagination cursor, loading/generation states
- **Browse UI:** `SongLibraryScreen.tsx` — genre carousel, 400ms debounced search, difficulty filter, song cards, request FAB
- **Playback UI:** `SongPlayerScreen.tsx` — section pills, layer toggle (melody/full), loop, `sectionToExercise()` → ExercisePlayer
- **Navigation:** Songs tab (5 tabs: Home, Learn, Songs, Play, Profile), SongPlayer stack route
- **6 achievements:** first-song-mastered, genre-explorer, classical-connoisseur, platinum-pianist, song-collector, melody-master
- **Mastery tiers:** none → bronze (70+/melody) → silver (80+/melody) → gold (90+/full) → platinum (95+/full)
- **Gem rewards on tier upgrade:** bronze=10, silver=20, gold=40, platinum=75

#### Content Import (124 songs uploaded to Firestore)
- **songAssembler.ts extraction:** Pure functions (buildSongPrompt, validateGeneratedSong, assembleSong) extracted from songGenerationService to `src/core/songs/songAssembler.ts` — enables Node.js scripts without Firebase/React Native deps
- **generate-songs.ts refactor:** Standalone Gemini 2.0 Flash API calls (no Firebase), resume support, JSON output, 50 curated songs → 37 successful
- **import-thesession.ts rewrite:** Two-step API (search → individual tune detail), constructs ABC headers from metadata, 50 folk tunes (20 reels + 15 waltzes + 15 jigs)
- **PDMX conversion (Python + music21):** Curated selection of 38 iconic classical pieces — 12 Beethoven (Op.18, Razumovsky, Harp Quartet, Große Fuge), 13 Mozart (K.545 Piano Sonata, The Hunt Quartet, K.155, K.156, K.80), 5 Haydn, 5 Bach chorales, Handel, Joplin, Chopin
- **upload-songs-to-firestore.ts:** Batch upload via Firebase client SDK, skip-existing, dry-run support
- **Final catalogue:** 124 songs (37 Gemini AI + 50 TheSession folk + 38 PDMX classical) across 6 genres (55 folk, 47 classical, 10 film, 7 game, 6 holiday)

- **Tests:** 103 suites, 2,413 tests (102 passing, 4 pre-existing failures in catEvolutionStore)

### Phase 8 Completion: Polyphonic Detection + Polish (Feb 26)

#### Polyphonic Detection Pipeline
- **PolyphonicDetector (src/input/PolyphonicDetector.ts):** ONNX Runtime wrapper for Spotify Basic Pitch model — resamples 44.1kHz→22.05kHz, runs inference on 88 note bins (A0-C8), extracts DetectedNote[] with confidence + onset flags, configurable thresholds (note=0.5, onset=0.5), max polyphony limit (default 6), pre-allocated resampling buffer
- **MultiNoteTracker (src/input/MultiNoteTracker.ts):** Per-note hysteresis for polyphonic input — 30ms onset hold, 60ms release hold, tracks Map<midiNote, {startTime, lastSeen}>, emits same NoteEvent interface as monophonic NoteTracker
- **AmbientNoiseCalibrator (src/input/AmbientNoiseCalibrator.ts):** Records ambient audio, computes RMS energy, auto-tunes YIN threshold (0.15-0.30), confidence (0.5-0.8), and ONNX note threshold (0.3-0.6) based on noise level

#### Integration
- **MicrophoneInput:** Now supports `mode: 'monophonic' | 'polyphonic'` — polyphonic uses PolyphonicDetector + MultiNoteTracker; falls back to YIN if ONNX fails
- **InputManager:** Reads `micDetectionMode` from settingsStore, passes to MicrophoneInput, adjusts latency compensation (100ms mono / 120ms poly)
- **settingsStore:** Added `micDetectionMode: 'monophonic' | 'polyphonic'` with setter
- **ProfileScreen:** Mic Detection picker (Single Notes / Chords) shown when input method is mic or auto

#### Infrastructure
- **onnxruntime-react-native:** Added as dependency (^1.17)
- **Metro config:** Added `.onnx` to asset extensions
- **Model docs:** assets/models/README.md with download instructions

- **Tests:** 106 suites, 2,441 tests, 0 failures, 0 TypeScript errors

### Phase 9.5: UX Overhaul (Feb 27)

#### Assessment Skill Seeding Fix
- **`getSkillsToSeedForLesson()`:** Now collects ALL prerequisite skills for the determined start lesson and all prior lessons (was only seeding 3 basic skills — `find-middle-c`, `keyboard-geography`, `white-keys` — regardless of placement at lesson-03 or higher)
- **LESSON_PREREQS map:** Explicit prerequisite chains for lessons 1-6, ensuring LevelMap shows correct tier progress after assessment

#### Challenge → AI Exercise Wiring
- **DailyChallengeCard "Play Now":** Now navigates to ExercisePlayer with `aiMode: true` and a challenge-category-mapped skill ID (was navigating to Learn tab with no exercise context)
- **Category mapping:** Challenge categories (e.g., `specific-category: 'scales'`) mapped to corresponding SkillTree skill IDs for targeted AI exercise generation

#### Mastery Tests for All 15 Tiers
- **Tiers 1-6:** Use existing static test exercises from JSON content
- **Tiers 7-15:** Use AI-generated tests via expanded `templateExercises.ts` with tier-specific skill mapping
- **`templateExercises.ts` expanded:** Added tier-to-skill mapping functions, enabling mastery test generation for all 15 tiers including AI-generated tiers

#### HomeScreen Redesign (Feed-Style Layout)
- **MusicLibrarySpotlight card:** Most prominent element after hero — gradient background, song count (124), genre count (6), featured song with play button, "Browse Library" CTA navigating to Songs tab
- **Continue Learning moved up:** Now immediately below Music Library spotlight (was buried below Salsa coach and daily rewards)
- **ReviewChallengeCard:** Conditional card shown when skills are decaying (14+ days unpracticed) — shows count badge and "Start Review" navigation
- **Quick Actions updated:** "Practice" replaced with "Songs" (music note icon, navigates to Songs tab) to drive Music Library engagement
- **Weekly/Monthly challenge cards removed:** Folded into daily challenge to reduce HomeScreen clutter

#### New Components
- **`MusicLibrarySpotlight.tsx`:** Gradient card with song/genre stats, featured song row (daily rotation), difficulty dots, Browse Library button
- **`ReviewChallengeCard.tsx`:** Warning-styled card with refresh icon, decay count badge, skill names, chevron CTA — returns null when no skills are decaying

- **Tests:** ~109 suites, ~2,500+ tests, 0 failures, 0 TypeScript errors
