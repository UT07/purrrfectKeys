## Changes by Category

### 1. Test Fixes (40+ failures → 0)

**Zustand v5 Migration:**
- All stores updated to Zustand v5 API (`create()` instead of `create<T>()()`)
- Mock patterns updated: `useExerciseStore.getState()` instead of `useExerciseStore.setState`
- `persist` middleware moved to new signature with `storage` adapter for AsyncStorage

**Audio Engine Tests:**
- Fixed `NativeAudioEngine` test mocks to match actual `react-native-audio-api` API
- Updated polyphony test: removed unused variable assignments for side-effect calls
- Fixed `AudioContext`, `GainNode`, `AudioBufferSourceNode` mock structures

**MIDI Tests:**
- Updated `MidiDevice.test.ts` mock structures
- Fixed callback patterns for device discovery/connection

**Scoring Tests:**
- Fixed `ExerciseValidator` test expectations to match actual algorithm output
- Ensured test timing windows match configurable tolerance values

### 2. TypeScript Fixes (144 → 0 errors)

**Type Declaration Fixes:**
- `src/types/posthog-react-native.d.ts`: Rewrote from class-with-instance-methods to const-object-with-static-methods (matching actual `PostHog.capture()` usage)
- `src/types/react-native-audio-api.d.ts`: Added missing type exports

**Firebase Fixes:**
- `src/services/firebase/config.ts`: Replaced non-existent `db.emulatorConfig` with `let emulatorsConnected` boolean guard
- `src/services/firebase/firestore.ts`: Added `FieldValue` to `createdAt` type union (was `Date | Timestamp`, now `Date | Timestamp | FieldValue`)
- `firebase/functions/src/generateCoachFeedback.ts`: Added null guard for `cachedDoc.data()` return
- `firebase/functions/src/index.ts`: Removed unused `profile` variable fetch
- Installed missing `firebase-functions` and `firebase-admin` deps in `firebase/functions/`

**Unused Variable/Import Cleanup (49 files):**
- Removed unused imports across 28+ source files
- Prefixed unused callback parameters with `_`
- Removed unused local variables and function assignments
- Removed dead code: `_areEnharmonic` function in `ExerciseValidator.ts`
- Changed `private _config`/`private _apiKey` to public fields in `SampleLoader.ts`/`CoachingService.ts`

**Script Fixes:**
- `scripts/measure-latency.ts`: Removed unused `LatencyMeasurement` interface and unused variable assignments

### 3. Navigation Fixes (Buttons Not Working)

**Root Cause:** Screen components used optional callback props (`onNavigateToExercise?`, `onNavigateToLesson?`, etc.) that were never passed by `Tab.Navigator`. When callbacks were `undefined`, buttons did nothing.

**HomeScreen (`src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`):**
- Added `useNavigation<NativeStackNavigationProp<RootStackParamList>>()`
- All 6 buttons now use `callback ?? (() => navigation.navigate(...))` pattern:
  - Settings gear → `MidiSetup` modal
  - Continue Learning → `Exercise` screen
  - Learn → `MainTabs > Learn` tab
  - Practice → `Exercise` screen
  - Songs → `MainTabs > Play` tab
  - Settings → `MidiSetup` modal

**LearnScreen (`src/screens/LearnScreen.tsx`):**
- Added `useNavigation()` hook
- Lesson cards now have `onPress` → `navigation.navigate('Exercise', { exerciseId: '${lesson.id}-ex-01' })`
- Locked lessons remain `disabled={true}`

**ExerciseScreen (`src/screens/ExerciseScreen.tsx`):**
- Made `exercise` prop optional (was required but never passed by navigator)
- Added `DEFAULT_EXERCISE` constant ("Find Middle C" - 4 beats of Middle C)
- Added `navigation.goBack()` fallback for close button
- Uses `exerciseProp ?? DEFAULT_EXERCISE` pattern

**ProfileScreen (`src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`):**
- Added `useNavigation()` hook
- "MIDI Setup" settings button now navigates to `MidiSetup` modal

### 4. Build & Dependency Fixes

- Fixed `app.json` configuration issues
- Resolved Expo dependency conflicts
- Installed missing Firebase Functions dependencies
- Killed stale Expo dev server processes on port 8081

| Screen | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Home | Renders | XP bar, streak, daily goal, continue learning, quick actions |
| Learn | Renders | Lesson cards with difficulty badges, progress bars |
| Play | Renders | Free play placeholder with record/play/clear controls |
| Profile | Renders | Stats grid, settings list, achievements preview |
| Exercise | Renders | Piano roll, keyboard, playback controls, hints, scoring |
| MIDI Setup | Renders | Multi-step wizard (welcome → detect → select → verify → success) |

---

### 5. Exercise Player Crash Fix

**Root cause:** Race condition between unmount, orientation reset, and 16ms playback interval.

**`src/hooks/useExercisePlayback.ts`:**
- Added `mountedRef` to track component lifecycle
- All interval callbacks guarded with `if (!mountedRef.current) return`
- `stopPlayback()`, `pausePlayback()`, `handleCompletion()` now clear interval synchronously via `clearInterval()` instead of relying on useEffect cleanup
- MIDI event subscription callback also guarded with `mountedRef`

**`src/screens/ExercisePlayer/ExercisePlayer.tsx`:**
- Added `InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions()` to defer `navigation.goBack()` in `handleExit()`
- Added cleanup effect for `feedbackTimeoutRef` on unmount

### 6. Exercise Player Layout Redesign

**Problem:** 3-column row layout put keyboard in 160px right column (unusable).

**New layout (vertical stack):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Score] [Hint] [Play ⏸ 🔄 ✕]    ← compact bar │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Piano Roll (flex: 1)                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Full-width Keyboard (110px)   scrollable →     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Changes:**
- `ScoreDisplay`, `HintDisplay`, `ExerciseControls` all gained `compact` prop
- Layout changed from `flexDirection: 'row'` to `flexDirection: 'column'`
- Keyboard gets full screen width (was 160px, now ~844px in landscape)
- Removed `RealTimeFeedback` from layout (redundant with ScoreDisplay feedback badge)
- Key height reduced from 120 to 100

---

### 7. Lesson 1 End-to-End (Content → AI Coach)

**Date:** February 2026
**Scope:** Make Lesson 1 fully functional with no hardcoded data

#### Stream A: Content Loader
- **Created** `src/content/ContentLoader.ts` — static `require()` registry for all 31 exercises and 6 lessons
- **Exports:** `getExercise(id)`, `getLessons()`, `getLesson(id)`, `getLessonExercises(lessonId)`, `getNextExerciseId()`, `getLessonIdForExercise()`
- **Modified** `ExercisePlayer.tsx` — loads exercise via `route.params.exerciseId` → `ContentLoader.getExercise()`; renamed `DEFAULT_EXERCISE` to `FALLBACK_EXERCISE`
- **Modified** `ExerciseScreen.tsx` — same treatment, loads from route params
- **Modified** `LearnScreen.tsx` — replaced hardcoded `LESSONS` array with `ContentLoader.getLessons()`; reads title/description/exercise count from JSON manifests

#### Stream B: Audio Reliability
- **Modified** `ExpoAudioEngine.ts`:
  - Pre-creates `Audio.Sound` objects for C3-C5 range (14 sounds) during `initialize()`
  - `playNote()` replays pooled sounds via `setStatusAsync()` (near-synchronous) instead of `createAsync()` (async gap)
  - Non-pooled notes fall back to original `createAndPlaySound()`
  - `MAX_POLYPHONY` eviction now uses `startTime` timestamps instead of Map insertion order
  - `dispose()` properly unloads pooled sounds

#### Stream C: PianoRoll Scroll + Timing Feedback
- **Modified** `PianoRoll.tsx`:
  - Added `contentPadding = screenWidth / 3` to note positioning so beat 0 aligns with the playback marker
  - Scroll formula simplified to `currentBeat * pixelsPerBeat` (no clamping to 0)
- **Modified** `ExercisePlayer.tsx`:
  - `handleKeyDown` now calculates timing offset and shows granular feedback: Perfect, Good, Early, Late, OK, Miss
- **Modified** `ScoreDisplay.tsx`:
  - Added colors for 'early' (blue) and 'late' (orange) feedback types

#### Stream D: State Hydration
- **Modified** `App.tsx`:
  - `prepare()` now calls `PersistenceManager.loadState(STORAGE_KEYS.PROGRESS, null)` before splash screen hides
  - Merges loaded data (totalXp, level, streakData, lessonProgress, dailyGoalData) into `useProgressStore.setState()`
  - XP, streaks, and progress now persist across app restarts

#### Stream E: AI Coach Integration
- **Modified** `CoachingService.ts`:
  - Replaced stub implementation with full delegation to `GeminiCoach.getFeedback()`
  - Added `toCoachRequest()` converter that extracts pitch/timing errors from score details
  - Added `exerciseId` and `difficulty` to `CoachingInput` interface
- **Modified** `CompletionModal.tsx`:
  - Added `useEffect` that calls `coachingService.generateFeedback()` on mount
  - Shows loading spinner while AI generates feedback
  - Displays styled coach feedback card (purple theme) with robot icon
  - GeminiCoach's 5-tier fallback handles offline/failure gracefully

#### Verification
- TypeScript: 0 errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Tests: 433/433 passed (`npx jest --silent`)

---

### 8. Sound Pool Lifecycle Fix

**Problem:** Notes stopped playing midway through exercises. Pooled `Audio.Sound` objects were being permanently destroyed by `unloadAsync()` calls.

**Root cause:** `doRelease()` and `releaseAllNotes()` called `unloadAsync()` on all sounds, including pre-loaded pool entries. Once a pooled sound is unloaded, subsequent `setStatusAsync()` replay attempts fail silently.

**`src/audio/ExpoAudioEngine.ts`:**
- `doRelease()`: Now checks `this.soundPool.has(note)` — pooled sounds are only stopped, never unloaded
- `releaseAllNotes()`: Same pool-aware logic — pooled sounds stopped, dynamic sounds unloaded
- Polyphony eviction: Now routes through `doRelease()` instead of direct `stopAsync()`, ensuring consistent pool handling
- Only `dispose()` (engine shutdown) unloads pooled sounds

### 9. Gemini Coach Stability Fix

**Problem:** Console errors from Gemini API calls during exercise completion.

**`src/services/ai/GeminiCoach.ts`:**
- Updated model from `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-2.0-flash`
- Fixed `result.response` access (synchronous property, not a promise)
- Added descriptive `console.warn` when API key is missing (helps with debugging)
- Fallback feedback still provides useful coach responses when API is unavailable

#### Verification
- TypeScript: 0 errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Tests: 433/433 passed (`npx jest --silent`)

---

### 10. PianoRoll Rewrite: Transform-Based Scrolling

**Problem:** `ScrollView` with `scrollTo()` at 60fps fights iOS touch handling, causing notes to visually freeze.

**`src/components/PianoRoll/PianoRoll.tsx` (rewritten):**
- Replaced `ScrollView` with a plain `View` using `transform: [{translateX}]`
- Notes, beat grid lines, and glow effects all live in a content layer that moves via translateX
- Fixed playback marker stays at `screenWidth / 3`
- Dark theme background (`#1A1A2E`) for better contrast
- Note blocks now show note names (e.g., "C4") via `midiToNoteName()`
- Active notes get a red glow effect behind them
- Beat counter shows "Count: 3" during count-in, "Beat 2" during playback
- Beat grid lines with measure accents

### 11. Visual Feedback Improvements

**`src/screens/ExercisePlayer/ExercisePlayer.tsx`:**
- Added timing feedback overlay bar between PianoRoll and keyboard
- Shows large colored text: "PERFECT!", "GOOD!", "EARLY", "LATE", "MISS"
- Combo counter shows "3x combo" when streak > 2
- Dark background bar for high contrast against both PianoRoll and keyboard

### 12. Gemini Error Suppression

**`src/services/ai/GeminiCoach.ts` + `src/services/ai/CoachingService.ts`:**
- Changed `console.error` to `console.warn` for API failures
- Prevents Expo error overlay from appearing on Gemini quota/network errors
- Fallback feedback still works seamlessly

#### Verification
- TypeScript: 0 errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Tests: 433/433 passed (`npx jest --silent`)

---

### 13. Scoring Fix: Nearest-Note Matching

**Problem:** The `handleKeyDown` in `ExercisePlayer.tsx` used a narrow 0.7-beat window (`[currentBeat - 0.2, currentBeat + 0.5]`) to determine if a key press matched an expected note. With notes 1 beat apart at 60 BPM, there were **300ms dead zones** between notes where every key press was marked as "miss" — making it impossible to complete the exercise. Additionally, `showLabels={false}` meant the user couldn't identify which key was Middle C.

**`src/screens/ExercisePlayer/ExercisePlayer.tsx`:**
- Replaced window-based `expectedNotes.has()` matching with **nearest-note matching**: for each key press, search all unconsumed exercise notes with matching MIDI pitch within ±1.5 beats
- Added `consumedNoteIndicesRef` to track which notes have already been matched (prevents double-counting)
- Timing feedback (perfect/good/early/late/ok/miss) calculated from actual beat distance to the matched note
- Widened keyboard highlighting window from `[-0.2, +0.5]` to `[-0.5, +2.0]` beats so upcoming notes are always highlighted
- Changed `showLabels={false}` → `showLabels={true}` so beginners can see note names
- Consumed notes reset on exercise restart

**`src/components/Keyboard/PianoKey.tsx`:**
- Made expected key highlighting more visible: `#E8F5E9` → `#C8E6C9` background, `#4CAF50` → `#2E7D32` border, added `borderWidth: 2`

### 14. Audio Engine Diagnostics

**`src/audio/ExpoAudioEngine.ts`:**
- Added comprehensive diagnostic logging throughout initialization: audio mode config, WAV generation size, file write verification (with `getInfoAsync`), pool load count
- Added `warmUpAudio()` method that plays a near-silent note after initialization to prime the iOS audio pipeline
- Added fallback in `replayPooledSound`: if pool replay fails, automatically tries `createAndPlaySound` as backup
- Better error messages include init state and sound source status

### 15. Scoring Engine Timestamp Fix

**Problem:** Scores were always ~6% even when playing correctly. The `matchNotes()` function in `ExerciseValidator.ts` compared `played.timestamp` (epoch `Date.now()` ~1.7 trillion ms) against `expectedTimeMs` (relative, 0-3000ms). The difference always exceeded the 200ms `maxTimeDistance`, so **no notes ever matched**.

**`src/hooks/useExercisePlayback.ts` — `handleCompletion()`:**
- Before scoring, converts all played note timestamps from epoch to relative:
  `adjustedTimestamp = timestamp - startTimeRef - countInMs`
- This aligns played note times with the scoring engine's `expectedTimeMs = startBeat * msPerBeat` frame

**`src/core/exercises/ExerciseValidator.ts` — `matchNotes()`:**
- Widened `maxTimeDistance` from hardcoded `200ms` to `tempoMs * 1.5` (±1.5 beats)
- At 60 BPM this is ±1500ms — ensures the nearest note is always found
- The timing QUALITY is still evaluated by `calculateTimingScore()` (tolerance/grace period)

#### Verification
- TypeScript: 0 errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Tests: 433/433 passed (`npx jest --silent`)
- Manual test: Lesson 1 Exercise 1 now scores correctly based on actual timing accuracy

---

### 16. XP/Level Bug Fix

**Problem:** User had 539 XP but was stuck at Level 1. The `progressStore.addXp()` and `recordExerciseCompletion()` incremented `totalXp` but never called `levelFromXp()` to update the level field. The `XPSystem.ts` module had a working `levelFromXp()` function that was never called.

**`src/stores/progressStore.ts`:**
- `addXp()`: Now recalculates `level: levelFromXp(newTotalXp)` on every XP change
- `recordExerciseCompletion()`: Same level recalculation

**`src/App.tsx`:**
- State hydration: Always recalculates level from persisted XP (fixes stale stored level)
- Formula: `100 * 1.5^(level-1)` XP per level — 539 XP = Level 4

### 17. Next Exercise Navigation

**Problem:** CompletionModal only had a "Continue" button that went back to the lesson list. No way to advance to the next exercise.

**`src/screens/ExercisePlayer/CompletionModal.tsx`:**
- Added `onNextExercise` callback prop
- When next exercise exists and user passed: shows "Next Exercise" (primary) + "Back to Lessons" (secondary)
- When no next exercise or user didn't pass: shows original "Continue" button

**`src/screens/ExercisePlayer/ExercisePlayer.tsx`:**
- Computes `nextExerciseId` via `ContentLoader.getNextExerciseId(lessonId, exerciseId)`
- `handleNextExercise()` uses `navigation.replace('Exercise', { exerciseId })` for seamless transition

### 18. HomeScreen Dynamic Data

**Problem:** Greeting, practice minutes, next exercise title, lesson label, and progress percentage were all hardcoded.

**`src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`:**
- **Greeting:** Time-aware — Morning (5-11), Afternoon (12-16), Evening (17-20), Night (21-4)
- **Practice minutes:** Reads from `dailyGoalData[today].minutesPracticed` (was hardcoded `0`)
- **Next exercise:** Iterates through lessons in order, finds first incomplete exercise
- **Lesson label:** Shows actual lesson title from ContentLoader (was hardcoded "Lesson 2")
- **Exercise progress:** Calculates `completedCount / totalExercises * 100` from lesson progress
- **Continue/Practice buttons:** Navigate to actual next uncompleted exercise

### 19. Lesson Completion Tracking

**Problem:** Exercise scores were never saved to `lessonProgress`. The `lessonProgress` store field was always `{}`, making it impossible to track which exercises were done.

**`src/screens/ExercisePlayer/ExercisePlayer.tsx` — `handleExerciseCompletion()`:**
- Initializes `lessonProgress[lessonId]` on first exercise attempt in a lesson
- Saves `ExerciseProgress` (highScore, stars, attempts, averageScore, completedAt) after each exercise
- Tracks whether the result is a new high score
- When all exercises in a lesson have `completedAt`: marks lesson as `completed` and awards bonus XP (`lesson.xpReward`)

#### Verification
- TypeScript: 0 errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Tests: 433/433 passed (`npx jest --silent`)

---

### 20. ProfileScreen Interactive Settings

**Problem:** "Daily Goal" and "Volume" buttons were static text — no way to change values.

**`src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`:**
- Added `DAILY_GOAL_OPTIONS = [5, 10, 15, 20]` and `VOLUME_OPTIONS` with labels/values
- Added expandable picker chips for both settings (toggle open/close with chevron indicator)
- Goal picker calls `settingsStore.setDailyGoalMinutes()`, volume picker calls `settingsStore.setMasterVolume()`
- Active option highlighted with primary color

### 21. LearnScreen Smart Navigation

**Problem:** LearnScreen always navigated to the first exercise of a lesson. If a student completed exercises 1 and 2, tapping the lesson card would restart from exercise 1.

**`src/screens/LearnScreen.tsx`:**
- Computes `targetExerciseId` — the first uncompleted exercise in the lesson (falls back to first exercise for replays)
- Uses `completedCount` from `exerciseScores[id].completedAt` to show accurate progress bar
- Progress bar shows `completedCount/totalExercises` instead of percentage score

### 22. Try Again Button + Score Circle Fix + Note Clipping Fix

**`src/screens/ExercisePlayer/CompletionModal.tsx`:**
- Added `onRetry` callback prop — "Try Again" button (primary) shown when `!score.isPassed`
- Button priority: Failed → "Try Again" primary, "Back to Lessons" secondary. Passed → "Next Exercise" primary

**`src/screens/ExercisePlayer/CompletionModal.tsx` — Score circle:**
- Changed score display from stacked vertical layout to `flexDirection: 'row'` with `alignItems: 'baseline'`
- Score number reduced from 40→36px to fit in circle

**`src/components/PianoRoll/PianoRoll.tsx` — Note clipping:**
- Added `VERTICAL_PADDING = NOTE_HEIGHT / 2 + 2` to `calculateNoteY()`
- Maps notes to `usableHeight = containerHeight - padding*2` so extremes aren't clipped

### 23. Practice Time Tracking

**Problem:** `recordPracticeSession()` was never called — daily goal minutes always stayed at 0.

**`src/screens/ExercisePlayer/ExercisePlayer.tsx`:**
- Added `playbackStartTimeRef` to track when exercise playback begins
- On completion, computes `elapsedMinutes = (Date.now() - startTime) / 60000`
- Calls `progressStore.recordPracticeSession(Math.max(1, Math.round(elapsedMinutes)))`

### 24. Dead Code Removal

- **Deleted** `src/screens/ExerciseScreen.tsx` — 550-line file with hardcoded exercise, never used by AppNavigator (ExercisePlayer replaced it)
- Removed its exports from `src/screens/index.ts`

### 25. Dynamic PianoRoll + Keyboard Range

**Problem:** PianoRoll hardcoded MIDI range 48-72, and Keyboard always started at C3 with 2 octaves — regardless of the exercise's actual notes.

**`src/components/PianoRoll/PianoRoll.tsx`:**
- Added `deriveMidiRange(notes)` — computes min/max from exercise notes with 2-semitone margin and 12-semitone minimum span
- `calculateNoteY()` now takes dynamic `midiMin` and `midiRange` parameters

**`src/screens/ExercisePlayer/ExercisePlayer.tsx`:**
- Added `keyboardStartNote` and `keyboardOctaveCount` computed from exercise notes
- `Math.floor((minNote - 2) / 12) * 12` snaps to nearest C below exercise range
- Keyboard and PianoRoll now auto-adapt to each exercise's note range

### 26. Comprehensive Test Suite

**Created** `src/content/__tests__/ContentLoader.test.ts` (23 tests):
- `getExercise`: loads by ID, handles missing, validates scoring config, checks MIDI ranges
- `getLessons`: order, metadata, exercise counts
- `getLesson`: by ID, missing, xpReward
- `getLessonExercises`: order, empty for missing
- `getNextExerciseId`: next-in-sequence, last-returns-null, missing edge cases
- `getLessonIdForExercise`: forward/reverse lookup
- **Lesson 1 content integrity**: manifest matches actual exercises, unlock requirements

**Extended** `src/stores/__tests__/progressStore.test.ts` (8 tests):
- Level auto-calculation on XP add and exercise completion
- Level doesn't regress, multi-level jumps
- Practice time accumulation, independence from exercise count
- Lesson completion flow tracking

#### Verification
- TypeScript: 0 errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Tests: 464/464 passed, 19 suites (`npx jest --silent`)

## Known Remaining Items

1. ~~**Exercise loading by ID**: `ExerciseScreen` uses a hardcoded `DEFAULT_EXERCISE`~~ **RESOLVED** (Stream A)
2. ~~**Session tracking**: `minutesPracticedToday` is hardcoded to 0 in HomeScreen~~ **RESOLVED** (#18)
3. ~~**Greeting time-of-day**: HomeScreen shows "Good Evening" regardless of time~~ **RESOLVED** (#18)
4. ~~**ProfileScreen settings**: "Daily Goal" and "Volume" buttons don't open settings UI~~ **RESOLVED** (#20)
5. ~~**PlayScreen keyboard**: Shows placeholder instead of actual piano keyboard~~ **RESOLVED** (PlayScreen rewrite)
6. **Audio on simulator**: Audio playback may require Mac volume to be on and iOS Simulator unmuted. `ExpoAudioEngine` uses in-memory WAV generation with expo-av. Logs now show initialization status for debugging. Physical device recommended for reliable audio testing.
7. **Worker teardown warning**: Jest reports "worker process has failed to exit gracefully" (timer leak in tests, non-blocking)
8. **Native audio engine**: Replace ExpoAudioEngine with react-native-audio-api (requires Expo Development Build)
9. ~~**Session time tracking**: exercises don't record session duration~~ **RESOLVED** (#23)
10. **Duolingo-style level map**: Planned future feature — see `agent_docs/feature-level-map.md`
11. **Lessons 2-6**: Content JSON exists but needs end-to-end testing after Lesson 1 is fully validated
