## Changes Summary

### Foundation (Sections 1-4)
- **Test fixes:** Zustand v5 migration, audio/MIDI/scoring mock updates (40+ failures → 0)
- **TypeScript fixes:** Type declarations, Firebase types, 49-file unused import cleanup (144 → 0 errors)
- **Navigation fixes:** Added `useNavigation()` hooks to all screens; buttons use `callback ?? navigate` pattern
- **Build fixes:** app.json config, Expo dependencies, Firebase Functions deps

### Exercise Player (Sections 5-6, 10-15, 22-25)
- **Crash fix:** `mountedRef` lifecycle guard, synchronous interval cleanup
- **Layout redesign:** Vertical stack (PianoRoll + full-width Keyboard) replacing 3-column layout
- **PianoRoll rewrite:** Transform-based scrolling replacing ScrollView (60fps smooth)
- **Scoring fix:** Nearest-note matching with ±1.5 beat window (replaced narrow 0.7-beat window)
- **Timestamp fix:** Epoch→relative conversion before scoring (was comparing trillion-ms vs relative-ms)
- **Dynamic range:** PianoRoll + Keyboard auto-adapt to exercise note range
- **Visual feedback:** PERFECT/GOOD/EARLY/LATE/MISS overlay with combo counter
- **Try Again button:** Context-aware buttons (retry on fail, next on pass)

### Content & State (Sections 7, 16-19, 23, 26, 28)
- **ContentLoader:** Static `require()` registry for 30 exercises and 6 lessons
- **XP/Level fix:** `addXp()` now recalculates level; state hydration recalculates from persisted XP
- **Next exercise navigation:** `navigation.replace('Exercise', { exerciseId })` for seamless flow
- **HomeScreen dynamic data:** Time-aware greeting, actual practice minutes, next uncompleted exercise
- **Lesson completion tracking:** Exercise scores saved to `lessonProgress`
- **Practice time tracking:** `playbackStartTimeRef` → `recordPracticeSession()` on completion
- **Content validation:** All 30 exercises pass MIDI range, sequencing, duration, scoring checks

### Audio (Sections 8-9, 14, 27, 33)
- **Sound pool lifecycle:** Pool-aware release (stop but never unload pooled sounds)
- **Round-robin voice pools:** 2 voices per note, atomic `replayAsync()`, no blocking flags
- **WebAudioEngine:** JSI-based via react-native-audio-api (factory falls back to ExpoAudioEngine)
- **Diagnostics:** Comprehensive init logging, `warmUpAudio()` primer, replay fallback

### UI & Gamification (Sections 20-21, 32, 34-35)
- **ProfileScreen:** Expandable picker chips for daily goal and volume settings
- **LearnScreen:** Smart navigation to first uncompleted exercise
- **Keysie mascot:** SVG cat avatar with 5 moods, per-mood animations, star particles
- **Transitions:** ExerciseCard (quick), LessonCompleteScreen (full celebration), AchievementToast
- **ScoreRing/PressableScale:** Reusable animated components

### Bug Fixes (Section 29, 36)
- **MIDI noteOff double-counting:** Filter to noteOn only
- **Pause resets exercise:** Save/restore elapsed time via `pauseElapsedRef`
- **Stale playedNotes:** `playedNotesRef` (useRef) for synchronous reads
- **MIDI timestamp normalization:** `Date.now()` override for consistent time domain
- **Streak logic:** Delegated to `XpSystem.recordPracticeSession()`

### Phase 6.5: AI Coach Fix + Wiring + FreePlay Fix (Feb 21)
- **AI Coach Pipeline (10 bugs):**
  - Fixed `pitchErrors` extraction (was always `[]` due to impossible triple-negation filter)
  - Fixed `missedCount`/`extraCount` derivation from score details (were undefined)
  - `ExerciseValidator.scoreExercise()` now populates `missedNotes`, `extraNotes`, `perfectNotes`, `goodNotes`, `okNotes`
  - `GeminiCoach` cache TTL reduced from 24h → 2h for response variety
  - `hashIssues` now includes actual error content (beat positions, offsets) — was zero-entropy
  - Gemini temperature increased from 0.7 → 0.85
  - `CompletionModal` passes real `recentScores` from progress store (was hardcoded `[]`)
  - `CompletionModal` passes real `sessionMinutes` from exercise timer
  - Offline coaching templates expanded from ~6 to ~15 per category
  - Fallback `'pitch'` branch is now live (pitchErrors populated)
- **FreePlayAnalyzer Key Detection:**
  - Expanded from 5 hardcoded scales to all 24 major + 24 minor keys
  - Added tonic weighting (first/last notes get +2 weight)
  - Added root bonus and out-of-scale penalty for better discrimination
  - `suggestDrill()` now derives tempo, difficulty, noteCount from session analysis
- **Gamification Wiring:**
  - `EvolutionReveal` wired into ExercisePlayer (detects stage change before/after XP)
  - Gem stats row added to CompletionModal
  - `evolutionStage` prop passed to CatAvatar on HomeScreen, ProfileScreen, CatCollectionScreen, CompletionModal
- **Tests:** 84 suites, 1,991 tests, 0 failures

## Known Remaining Items

1. **Worker teardown warning**: Jest reports "worker process has failed to exit gracefully" (timer leak, non-blocking)
2. **Native audio engine**: ExpoAudioEngine primary; react-native-audio-api requires RN 0.77+ for codegen
3. **Native MIDI module**: `react-native-midi` not installed yet (needs RN 0.77+). VMPK + IAC Driver ready
4. **Open bugs on GitHub**: ~53 remaining open issues
5. **Rive animation files**: .riv files not created (need Rive editor design work) — SVG composable system is working alternative
6. **Phase 7 Batches 7-10 remaining**: Remaining screen redesigns (AuthScreen, LevelMapScreen, OnboardingScreen), micro-interactions (PressableScale upgrade, animated progress bars, loading skeletons, celebration upgrades), Detox visual audit
7. **Phase 8+**: Audio input (mic polyphonic detection), Social & Leaderboards, QA + Launch
