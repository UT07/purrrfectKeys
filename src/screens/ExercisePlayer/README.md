## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { ExercisePlayer } from '@/screens/ExercisePlayer';

<ExercisePlayer
  exercise={myExercise}
  onExerciseComplete={(score) => {
    console.log('Score:', score.overall, 'Stars:', score.stars);
  }}
  onClose={() => navigation.goBack()}
/>
```

### With Route-Based Loading (Standard Usage)

```typescript
// Exercise is loaded automatically from route params via ContentLoader
navigation.navigate('Exercise', { exerciseId: 'lesson-01-ex-01' });
// ExercisePlayer reads route.params.exerciseId and calls getExercise()
```

## Components

### ExercisePlayer
Main orchestrator component. Handles playback timing, keyboard input, and state management.

### ScoreDisplay
Real-time progress and scoring display. Shows title, progress bar, combo counter, and feedback.

### ExerciseControls
Play, pause, restart, and exit button controls with proper state management.

### HintDisplay
Contextual hints that change based on exercise state (before start, during play, after feedback).

### CountInAnimation
Full-screen countdown animation before exercise starts with haptic cues.

### RealTimeFeedback
Visual feedback indicator showing note accuracy and expected notes.

### CompletionModal
Results screen with celebration, score breakdown, XP, high score indication, AI coach feedback, "Try Again" button (on failure), and "Next Exercise" navigation.

## Architecture

### Playback Loop
- Updates at 60fps (16ms intervals)
- Calculates beat position from elapsed time and tempo
- Updates expected notes for current position
- Detects exercise completion

### Input Handling
- Captures keyboard note presses
- Nearest-note matching within ±1.5 beats (no dead zones)
- Consumed-note tracking prevents double-counting
- Generates timing feedback (Perfect/Good/Early/Late/Miss)
- Updates combo counter
- Triggers haptic feedback

### Scoring
- Collects all played notes with timestamps
- Converts epoch timestamps to beat-relative before scoring
- Integrates with ExerciseValidator for timing/accuracy analysis
- Calculates final score (Accuracy 40% + Timing 35% + Completeness 15% + Precision 10%)
- Determines XP earned and star rating (0-3)
- Checks for new high score
- Persists scores to lessonProgress in progressStore

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state
- Integrates with Zustand stores (exerciseStore + progressStore) for persistence
- Manages playback, keyboard input, and feedback state
- Keyboard range and PianoRoll dynamically derived from exercise notes
- Practice time tracked from playback start to completion
- Lesson progress and completion tracked automatically

## Performance

### Optimization Techniques
- Components memoized with React.memo
- Event handlers wrapped in useCallback
- Animations use react-native-reanimated native driver
- Heavy computations memoized with useMemo
- Efficient state updates with proper dependencies

### Performance Targets
- Playback: 60fps (16ms per frame)
- Touch feedback: <50ms
- Keyboard input: <20ms
- Component renders: <16ms

### Monitoring
- All intervals and animations properly cleaned up
- No memory leaks from unclosed connections
- Performant re-render strategy
- Optimized animation performance

## Accessibility

- Full screen reader support
- Semantic labels on all interactive elements
- High contrast feedback colors
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Keyboard navigation (web)
- Accessibility announcements for state changes

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

Tests cover:
- Component rendering
- Playback control
- Keyboard input
- Score calculation
- Exercise completion
- State management
- Accessibility

## Browser Support

- ✅ iOS (Expo)
- ✅ Android (Expo)
- ✅ Web (limited MIDI support)

## Dependencies

- `react-native` - Core UI framework
- `react-native-reanimated` - 60fps animations
- `expo-haptics` - Haptic feedback
- `zustand` - State management
- `@expo/vector-icons` - Icons

## Common Tasks

### Add Exercise to Player

```typescript
const exercise: Exercise = {
  id: 'my-exercise',
  version: 1,
  metadata: {
    title: 'My Lesson',
    description: 'Learn some notes',
    difficulty: 2,
    estimatedMinutes: 5,
    skills: ['c-major'],
    prerequisites: [],
  },
  settings: {
    tempo: 120,
    timeSignature: [4, 4],
    keySignature: 'C',
    countIn: 4,
    metronomeEnabled: true,
  },
  notes: [
    { note: 60, startBeat: 4, durationBeats: 1 },
    { note: 64, startBeat: 5, durationBeats: 1 },
  ],
  scoring: {
    timingToleranceMs: 50,
    timingGracePeriodMs: 150,
    passingScore: 70,
    starThresholds: [70, 85, 95],
  },
  hints: {
    beforeStart: 'Ready?',
    commonMistakes: [],
    successMessage: 'Great!',
  },
};
```

### Handle Score Submission

```typescript
const handleComplete = async (score: ExerciseScore) => {
  // Update local progress
  updateProgress({
    exerciseId: exercise.id,
    highScore: Math.max(score.overall, prevHighScore),
    stars: Math.max(score.stars, prevStars),
  });

  // Submit to backend
  await submitScore(exercise.id, score);

  // Navigate to results
  navigation.navigate('Results', { score });
};
```

### Customize Feedback Colors

The component uses standard colors defined in component styles. To customize:

```typescript
// In ScoreDisplay.tsx, ExerciseControls.tsx, etc.
const COLORS = {
  primary: '#2196F3',      // Blue
  success: '#4CAF50',      // Green
  warning: '#FF9800',      // Orange
  error: '#F44336',        // Red
  // ... etc
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Playback not starting
- Verify exercise object is valid
- Check that `isPlaying` prop is properly set
- Ensure count-in beats is greater than 0

### No feedback displayed
- Check `feedback` state is being updated
- Verify expected notes match keyboard input
- Ensure feedback auto-clear timeout isn't interfering

### Animations stuttering
- Check that native driver is enabled
- Reduce number of simultaneous animations
- Profile with React Native Debugger

### Memory warnings
- Ensure intervals are cleaned up in useEffect cleanup
- Check for memory leaks in event handlers
- Profile with Chrome DevTools
